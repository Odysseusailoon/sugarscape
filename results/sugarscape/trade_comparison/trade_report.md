# Trade Effect Analysis: Sugarscape Spice

## 1. Experiment Overview
Comparison of two identical simulations where agents need both Sugar and Spice to survive.
- **No Trade**: Agents must self-sufficiently harvest both resources.
- **With Trade**: Agents can barter Sugar for Spice (and vice versa) based on MRS.

## 2. Key Findings

### A. Survival
- **No Trade Final Population**: 500 ticks -> 250 agents
- **With Trade Final Population**: 500 ticks -> 250 agents

### B. Welfare (Utility)
- **No Trade Mean Welfare**: 29.92
- **With Trade Mean Welfare**: 33.49
- **Improvement**: 11.9%

## 3. Conclusion
Trade allows agents to specialize (or survive in biased regions) and exchange surplus for scarcity, leading to higher overall welfare and survival rates (Pareto improvement).
