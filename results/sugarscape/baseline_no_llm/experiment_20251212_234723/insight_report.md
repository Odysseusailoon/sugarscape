# Sugarscape Deep Insight Report

## 1. Executive Summary
This experiment demonstrates the emergence of **extreme inequality** and **natural selection** in a simple resource-constrained environment. Despite random initialization, the society evolves into a distinct class structure.

## 2. Key Findings

### A. The "Genetic" Lottery (Selection Effects)
- **Metabolism is Destiny**: The surviving population has an average metabolism of **1.99** (Initial exp: 2.5). Lower metabolism agents have a massive survival advantage.
- **Vision Matters Less**: The average vision is **3.77**. While helpful, it is secondary to metabolic efficiency.

### B. Wealth Inequality
- **Gini Coefficient**: **0.48** (High inequality).
- **The 10% Rule**: The top 10% of agents hold **30.3%** of the total wealth.
- **Wealth Determinants**: As shown in the correlation matrix, Wealth is negatively correlated with Metabolism.

## 3. Conclusion
The Sugarscape simulation confirms Epstein & Axtell's finding that **heterogeneity** (differences in internal attributes) combined with **resource scarcity** inevitably leads to skewed wealth distributions, even without explicit exploitation mechanisms.
