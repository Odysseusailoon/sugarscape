# Deep Dive: The Genetic Lottery of Conservatives

## Hypothesis
User suspects that Type A (Conservative) agents are efficient not because of their strategy, but because they survived the "Genetic Lottery" (i.e., they happen to have the lowest metabolism).

## Data Analysis (SugarSpice Environment)
- **Correlation (Metabolism vs Efficiency)**: 0.187 (Negative = Lower metabolism leads to higher efficiency)
- **Mean Metabolism (High Efficiency Group)**: 3.65
- **Mean Metabolism (Low Efficiency Group)**: 3.83
- **Overall Mean Metabolism**: 3.74

## Conclusion
Does low metabolism explain the success?
If correlation is strongly negative (e.g., < -0.5), then yes, they are just "lucky dieters".
If correlation is weak, then the strategy matters.
