# Deep Dive: The Conservative Efficiency Paradox

## Context
In the complex **SugarSpice** environment, Conservative (Type A) agents achieved the highest resource accumulation efficiency (`Utility/Age = 1.88`), outperforming even the Risk-takers.

## Vision Analysis
- **Overall Mean Vision**: 3.53
- **High Efficiency Group Mean Vision**: 3.54
- **Correlation (Vision vs Efficiency)**: 0.003

## Interpretation
Is their efficiency driven by high vision?
If correlation is low, it suggests their strategy (safety first) is robust regardless of vision.
If correlation is high, it suggests only "Eagle-eyed Conservatives" are the true Pareto optimal agents.
